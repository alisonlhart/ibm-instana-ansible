# ibm-instana-ansible

The IBM Instana collection provides the ability for Instana event data to be consumed by Event Driven Ansible (EDA). In EDA, rulebooks are defined with 'If-This-Then-That' conditions. The condition uses parsed Instana event data to trigger automation. This enables you to build existing operational knowledge into automated decision-making and actions, so that you can efficiently perform repetitive tasks and deliver services faster, with far less effort while reducing Mean-Time-To-Resolution (MTTR).
